ucarp (1.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version introduces support for sending and receiving broadcast
  advertisements, instead of multicast, through the use of the new
  -M/--nomcast command argument.

  It is also now possible to configure deadratio, xparam, and nomcast
  from /etc/network/interfaces. See /usr/share/doc/ucarp/README.Debian
  for a full list of configuration directives.

ucarp (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version introduces support for ignoring interface state
  through the use of the -S/--ignoreifstate option. This is useful
  when nodes are connected by a crossover cable where powering down
  one node will drop the link of the other, causing an unwanted
  transition to backup on the remaining node.

ucarp (1.5~snap080222-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Ucarp supports two new arguments.

  The --passfile argument can be used to specify a file containing
  the password, (previously set by using --pass/-o). This provides
  additional security by not exposing the password through the
  process list. The specified file should contain the password as
  the only line in the file.

  The --xparam argument makes it possible to specify an additional
  parameter to supply to the up/down scripts.

ucarp (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  It is now possible to configure ucarp from /etc/network/interfaces,
  see /usr/share/doc/ucarp/README.Debian to learn how.

ucarp (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Ucarp's default behavior is to execute the command specified by 
  the --downscript option on every transition to the "backup" state.
  This version introduces the --neutral option that suppresses this 
  on start up if "backup" is the initial state. It is always good 
  practice to use an idempotent downscript, but if that is not 
  possible then the --neutral may be of help.
